  Adds a line segment to a drawing.

  ARGUMENTS:

  - D -- the drawing to which the segment will be added.

  - x1, y1, x2, y2 -- endpoints of the line segment: (x1, y1) and 
    (x2, y2).

  - thickness -- line thickness.

  Adds a circle to the the drawing.

  ARGUMENTS:

  - r -- radius.

  - thickness -- line thickness.

  - filled -- nonzero if the circle is filled; zero otherwise.

  Saves drawing as a PGM file.

  ARGUMENTS:

  - D -- the drawing.

  - pix_per_unit -- number of pixels to be used per unit.

  - sample_type -- type of sampling technique. GRID_SAMPLE means that
    a uniform grid of size sample_size x sample_size is sampled inside
    a pixel. RANDOM_SAMPLE means that sample_size random points are
    sampled inside each pixel.

  - sample_size -- determines size of sample; see sample_type above.

  - outfile -- output stream.

  Returns zero if the image was saved successfuly, or an error code
  (see top of this file) otherwise.
